            This is the three ingredient recipe for a cookies and cream mousse. I love mousse.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 chocolate sandwich cookies, plus more for topping</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the cream from the chocolate sandwich cookies. Place the cookies in a plastic bag and the cream in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, crush the cookies until they are finely ground.</li>
            <li>Microwave the cream from the chocolate sandwich cookies for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a chilled medium bowl, beat the heavy cream using a hand mixer until thick and frothy.</li>
            <li>Add the cream from the cookies and the powdered sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs, saving some as topping for later.</li>
            <li>Spoon into a piping bag or plastic bag with a piping tip. Pipe into serving bowls or glasses.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs and half of a chocolate sandwich cookie, if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
